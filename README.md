# IRIS_Project_using_KNN
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on their morphological characteristics using data provided in an Excel sheet. The classic Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers described by four features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—will be used. The objective is to classify these samples into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. 

This project will provide hands-on experience with data analysis, machine learning, and model deployment using the well-known Iris dataset in an Excel format to build a predictive model for iris species classification.
